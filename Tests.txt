Game was designed to keep in mind as follows : 

1. board size is max 100

2. Normal dice can throw any number b/w 1 to 6
3. Normal dice output should not be less or equal to 0.
4. Normal dice output should not be more than 6. 

5. Crooked dice will always throw a even number 
6. Crooked dice output can be 2,4,6

7. User can choose , how many turns want to play 
8. for providing no input for turns , player can provide max three incorrect input
9. If not provided correct input then game will continue with Default number of turns (which is 10).

10. User can select WHich dice he want to use ( Normal or crooked) 
11. Until user didnt select the correct dice to play , game will not start.

12. Max board size is 100, so player cannot move beyond 100.

13. before end point , if player reaches a number <100 but his current position + dice output >100 then player will not move from his current location.
And needs to roll dice again.
